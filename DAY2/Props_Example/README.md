props :- 

1. props stand fro properties.
2. Props are use to pas the data from parent component to child component.
3. props are like function arguments in js and components receive them like parameters.

How props work :-
parent comp :- send data
child comp :- receive props as a parameter.



important :
props are read only :- you cannot change props inside child components.
Props can be any type : String , Number , Object , Array , Function
Good for reusable comp :- send diff props to create flexible components
